1. Loops

Outer Loop → Controls the number of rows (1 to 5).

Inner Loop → Controls how many times the number is printed in each row.

2. Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop.

Outer loop = row number

Inner loop = repeat count for that row

3. Variables

Used to store loop counters like i and j.

4. Conditional-Free Logic

No if condition is needed.

The row number itself decides how many times it prints.

5. Output Formatting

Using print without newline inside inner loop.

Using print with newline after each row.

6. Iteration Control

Loop starts at 1 and ends at 5.

Increases step by step to build the pyramid.
